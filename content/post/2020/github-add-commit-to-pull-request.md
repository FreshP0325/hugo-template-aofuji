Sometimes we need to make changes to the pull request submitted to our project by community developers, such as additions to configuration files and resource files. In this case, we can just reply to the request with the changes, but there is a simpler option: we can submit a commit directly to the pull request.

<!--more-->

In the implementation example below, the username of the repository maintainer (me) is `amzrk2` and the developer submitting the request is `Hyask`. The example pull request modifies the file and pushes it directly from the other `master` branch to the `master` branch of the repository at [hugo-theme-fuji](https://github.com/amzrk2/hugo-theme-fuji).
